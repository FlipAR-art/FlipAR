# FlipAR
FlipAR is basically an open-source animation editor for augmented reality scenes using:
* the browser's 3D WebGL/WebGPU engine,
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) , 
* [R3F](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (React Three Fiber) 
* [DREI](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
* [R3F/XR](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-xr)
* [Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/). 

It is also Open Format and use Creative Common contents.
  
It's also a playground for testing the new [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) detection libraries, which now enable work on : 

```
⇾ curved and non-curved objects
⇾ Images
⇾ Flat surfaces
⇾ Curved surfaces
⇾ Face
⇾ Fingers
⇾ Segmentation
```

Connected to an API :

⇾ We use [Strapi.js](https://strapi.io/) as content manager with dedicated plugins for GLTF optimization, IPFS, QRCODE, AI ...
⇾ It becomes an open community site [FlipAR.art](https://www.flipar.art),
⇾ users can register:
     ⇾ via email on the API
     ⇾ Google
     ⇾ Twitter
     ⇾ Instagram
     ⇾ Facebook
     ⇾ LinkedIn
     ⇾ Twitch
     ⇾ TikTok
```
⇾ One simple rule, all content must be free and Creative Common to be shared between users.  

```
⇾ Each user can create their own augmented reality scenes, 
  ⇾ import objects and other 3D elements in open formats
  ⇾ compress texture and optimize object
  ⇾ geolocate them as required 
  ⇾ generate a QRCODE that links to the web animation page. 
```
